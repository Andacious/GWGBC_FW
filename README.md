Quotes are from funnyplaying directly, bullet points are me paraphrasing. 

# 0725
* No internal version number -- Fixes audio pop on start and adds stereo support to speaker
* Not first firmware version but first firmware version that can be flashed without a dedicated FPGA programmer. 

# 0823
* No internal version number -- Fixes GB Camera and Pokemon Crystal (US) compatibility and other SRAM/FRAM cart compatibility

# 0928
> This version is unstable Other new problems have emerged
> The timing is already saturated  ï¼ŒFurther details need to be optimized
> It's better not to update yet  Waiting for my new version

# 1005
* No internal version number -- added variable clock control
* Version 0.86? I think my notes are wrong
* Looks to be missing a screen display mode, full + pixel grid
IMPORTANT -- When updating to this build or newer from an older build, it is possible to glitch your display mode. Full Screen + Pixel Grid mode was REMOVED but the configuration does NOT reset upon reflashing. Recommend change display mode before updating. If your display mode gets glitched, roll your firmware back to an earlier version, change display modes, then try again.
