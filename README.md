# GWGBC_FW

UPDATE 2024-01-12: A new hardware revision of this started shipping a couple weeks ago. This new variant (v1.1) is largely the same but uses an external crystal oscilator whereas the original hardware uses an internal frequency generator. I'm not sure the implications here (perhaps more accurate clock speed or improved overclocking?) but Funnyplaying has confirmed that new firmware is required. Therefor, this repo is ONLY for v1.0 and pre-release hardware at this time. I will re-organize and update before or when firmware for the new model is released. Flashing the old firmware to the new model or vice versa will NOT damage either unit though the device will not work properly until reflashed with the matching firmware. 

This is the historical firmware repository for the original hardware release of the Funnyplaying FPGA GBC. No warranty, flash at your own risk, etc. etc. The firmware for the circuit that deals with updates is separate from the firmware for the rest of the device so a failed update is as easy to recover from as just attempting to update again. That being said, the firmware updates can be extremely tempermental. Sometimes it just works, sometimes it doesn't work no matter what and it just starts working again later. You have been warned.

If your device works and you're not missing \<feature\> that was added after release, probably just leave well enough alone. If you insist anyway but are having trouble deciding what to install, [this firmware](1117/) seems to be working pretty well.

A Windows PC ([or Windows 10 Phone](https://twitter.com/makhowastaken/status/1727496794333237599)) is REQUIRED for Firmware updates. Ubuntu, macOS, Android (Samsung), and iOS (iPadOS) all tested failed. The issue appears related to how the OS itself handles mounted file systems and file transfers. I have found and tested a repeatable workaround for openSUSE user~~s~~ and I still need to work on paring down the steps, isolating the specific issue, and making it easily repeatable (via BASH script or something) though I am unlikely to make any progress on this. I have not found any workarounds for macOS devices aside from just installing Windows via a bootcamp partition (so good luck anyone with Apple hardware made in the last four years). 

Sniffing some packets of a successful update (on Windows) and comparing to those from a failed update (on macOS), it looks like updating is handled via some form of DAPLink implementation so the observed behavior may [have the same cause.](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink/issues/982) Despite that, however, the listed workarounds are NOT working. 

## Updating

So you've decided to tinker despite the numerous warnings. I certainly don't blame you but keep in mind that I am NOT funnyplaying nor am I on their payroll. We just have a good working relationship via mutual partners. If you run into technical issues updating, no support will be provided. You have been warned. Again. 

Instructions on this process in video linked above; skip to the one hour mark.

To update: 
* On your favorite Windows PC (10/11 tested and verified, older versions should work too), download the firmware "update.bin" file for the firmware you wish to flash.
* File must be named "update.bin". You cannot rename after copying. 
* Switch FPGA GBC on with no game inserted
* Plug console into PC via USB C data cable (USB 2.0 is fine but USB 3.0 or USB C host type cables should also work)
* Copy "update.bin" file over to 1MB "FUNNY_PLAY_" file system
* Device will automatically update and reboot
* Device may now be disconnected or switched off (or just played, I don't judge) once file copy completed

Note that sometimes file copy may fail or get stuck at around 27% and device may only be partially updated. If this happens, unplug device, power cycle, and repeat steps. If this happens repeatedly, you may attempt to copy via powershell. If it's still failing, restart your PC and try again or try a different PC.

  Powershell example: `Copy-Item .\update.bin -Destination e:`
  
  Copy-Item *<path to "update.bin" file>* -Destination *<drive letter of "FUNNY_PLAY_">*

# Version Notes: *work in progress*

These firmware files have been provided to me via Funnyplaying directly and published with their permission. I have not coded, compiled, or had any involvement on the technical side here. My only direct involvement was an unpaid* QA role. They provided me the device and firmware files, I provide(d) them actionable feedback on the device. If you have feature requests or bug reports, I recommend you contact funnyplaying directly. Scroll to the bottom for more on planned features and updates.

* bullet points are me paraphrasing.

I don't have proper change logs for these updates. I only have context clues from funnyplaying directly and they communicate via a translator so sometimes context is lost. Internal build numbers just look to be based on the compilation date so build `0725` is an unknown version but it was compiled from the main branch `July 25th (of 2023)`. Sometimes there are two firmware updates the same day and FP will tack on a `.1` or `01` interchangeably. 

### [0725](0725)
* No internal version number -- Fixes audio pop on start and adds stereo support to speaker
* Not first firmware version but first firmware version that can be flashed without a dedicated FPGA programmer. Earlier versions not provided (and not yet dumped)

### [0823](0823)
* No internal version number -- Fixes GB Camera and Pokemon Crystal (US) compatibility and other SRAM/FRAM cart compatibility (insideGadgets and HDR carts)
* Adds GBC palette mode display option. Toggle this option if sprites do not render properly in games under the GBC core (e.g. GB game running under GBC core may require a different option than just using the GB core)
* "Engineering test build" -- menu open on every boot (may simply be closed)

### [082301](082301)
* Unknown changes, no notes, not tested

### [0928](0928)
> This version is unstable Other new problems have emerged

> The timing is already saturated  ï¼ŒFurther details need to be optimized

> It's better not to update yet  Waiting for my new version

* Unknown changes, not tested

### [1005](1005)
* No internal version number -- added variable clock rate control
* Version 0.86? I think my notes are wrong
* Looks to be missing a screen display mode, full + pixel grid

IMPORTANT -- When updating to this build or newer from an older build, it is possible to glitch your display mode. Full Screen + Pixel Grid mode was REMOVED but the configuration does NOT reset upon reflashing. Recommend change display mode before updating. If your display mode gets glitched, roll your firmware back to an earlier version, change display modes, then try again. 

### [1010](1010)
* Version 0.87 in the menu -- lowered speaker minimum volume 
* Fixed unknown (to me) audio issues in some games. I didn't press for specifics. 
* If you want factory firmware, this is it. 

### [1015](1015)
* Unknown changes, no notes, not tested

### [10.25](10.25)
* Version 0.88 in the menu
* Unknown changes, not tested
* Latest stable version
* **This is the version FP recommends.** 

### [10.25.1](10.25.1)
* Unknown changes, not tested
> There's a big problem

### [1117](1117)
* Version 0.89 in the menu
* Fixed backlight management and controls
* Experimental sleep mode -- press and hold menu button to sleep or wake device
* **This is the version I recommend.** 

### Unknown Build
* Version 0.9 in the menu
* Initial firmware on v1.1 hardware revisions
* Unknown changes

### [2024.1.old](2024.1.old)
* Version 1.02 in the menu
* Updated boot screens now use Funnyplaying logos instead of Nintendo logos
> Optimised left and right channels
* Fixed Tetris multiplayer link
* Graphical corruption on first boot[^2]
* Latest test version.

Please [reach out to funnyplaying directly](https://funnyplaying.com/pages/contact-us) if you have any bug reports or feature requests not listed below. 

I've made lots of feature requests of funnyplaying and they've implemented at least some. We're still working out the kinks. Here is a short list of things that *have already been requested and acknowledged by funnyplaying*:
* LUTs for display accurate color correction (planned for future FW)
* More pixel grid modes; feature parity with their Game Boy Color Q5 laminated backlight kit (planned for future FW)
* Lower minimum speaker volume[^1]
* SD Card support
  * Flashing flashcarts (e.g. to replace burnmaster)
  * system updates
  * save states
  * and you know why. 
* Game Boy Advance support
* IR functionality
* AA battery support (really, guys?)
* faster charging

Funnyplaying has mentioned some of these features in a way that sounds like they're trying to add to the next FW revision (pixel grid modes). From the inception of the device, Funnyplaying has planned IR function but since the retail boards have shipped without the requisite hardware, I wouldn't hold my breath. I'd treat the rest of these features like that too. Other features they want to add not just to the device but to their backlight kits too (like LUTs) and I expect them to show up there first. 

In the short term, funnyplaying is planning a minor hardware revision to address some issues. I don't know what specifically, but I'd expect faster charging support and probably a much less tempermental firmware updater. Maybe a larger internal EEPROM to give more space for more *yet to be implemented* features. I expect these devices to start shipping without any fanfare and I'd expect them as early as batch two or three. In this short term, I also expect two re-releases of this device, one in DMG form-factor and another in MGB form-factor. The internal hardware, support, and features will be identical to this version, only the shape of the boards will be different for install in the respective shells. 

While SD Card support and Game Boy Advance functionality are both planned features, I would not expect either until a full hardware refresh happens and seeing as the engineering team is currently occupied finishing this device (despite it's very recent release), I don't expect that for a while. Probably two to three years, given funnyplaying's track record with promises and deliveries. Funnyplaying iterates on hardware designs though and now that they've gotten all their iterative designs working together, development may hasten. 

[^1]: So this console is so authentic, the amp makes a noticeable buzzing noise that sounds eerily similar to the CPU sound leaks on actual CGBs. Funnyplaying intentionally gimps the minimum volume levels to mask this. (It's not the same noise, just similar)

[^2]: After updating to the test version 1.02, my console experienced bootlooping and severe graphical corruption for the first several boots. After about five power cycles, the problem hasn't reocurred. I was able to reproduce this exact behavior on a second unit by going from the most recent firmware to this version.
